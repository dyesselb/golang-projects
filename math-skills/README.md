project is made in Go.

Program must be able to read from a file and print the result of each statistic mentioned above. 
In other words, your program must be able to read the data present in the path passed as argument.

This data represents a graph in which the values of the x axis are the number of the lines (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ...) and the values of the y axis are the actual numbers (189, 113, 121, 114, 145, 110...).

After reading the file, your program must execute each of the calculations asked above and print the results in the following manner:

Average: <number> 

Median: <number> 

Variance: <number>
